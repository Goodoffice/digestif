[Prospect names],

Recently I came across [Company name] in the [Directory where I found their
information] and I wanted to reach out. My name is Jake Jorgovan and recently I
finished up a website design project for [case study client] and wanted to
reach out to similar companies.

When I came across the [Client's website], I noticed [review of 2-3 things
that I found wrong with the clients website]. With the [case study client], we
were able to build a professional site and get it up and running in under
three weeks. Their site is mobile friendly and extremely easy for anyone at
the company to update.

If you are interested in rebuilding your website, please let me know and we
would be more than happy to help you out. Also, I have attached a case study
for [Case study client] with a raving testimonial from the owner of the
company.

Thank you [Prospect name] and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Jake Jorgovan
